// Write a Java program to determine whether a given positive n-digit number is a Keith number. A Keith number is a number that appears in a special sequence generated using its digits. The sequence starts with the digits of the number, and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous n terms.
// For example, to check if 742 is a Keith number:
// Separate each digit: 7, 4, 2.
// Generate the sequence by adding the last three terms:
// 7, 4, 2
// 7 + 4 + 2 = 13 → 7, 4, 2, 13
// 13 + 2 + 4 = 19 → 7, 4, 2, 13, 19
// 19 + 13 + 2 = 34 → 7, 4, 2, 13, 19, 34
// 34 + 19 + 13 = 66 → 7, 4, 2, 13, 19, 34, 66
// 66 + 34 + 19 = 119 → 7, 4, 2, 13, 19, 34, 66, 119
// 119 + 66 + 34 = 219 → 7, 4, 2, 13, 19, 34, 66, 119, 219
// 219 + 119 + 66 = 404 → 7, 4, 2, 13, 19, 34, 66, 119, 219, 404
// 404 + 219 + 119 = 742 → 7, 4, 2, 13, 19, 34, 66, 119, 219, 404, 742
// Since the sequence eventually includes the original number 742, it is a Keith number.
